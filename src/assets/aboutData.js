                "Winter of Code has a philosophy very similar to larger programs like GSoC and Outreachy. Winter of Code is designed to acclimatize people to the steps involved in taking up various projects in large organizations like VLC, Mozilla, and others through GSoC and other similar programs.",
                "The participants will learn how to prepare a project  application, work in teams, understand the importance of effective communication, and most importantly, work with large codebases. They will also learn the intricate workflows and good coding practices."

The students can work with projects proposed by the Technical clubs, Open Source Organizations and Faculty Members of NITK over the winter break. This program also plans to introduce to students the rigorous process of developing a project proposal similar to that of GSoC.",
            "A team of students will act as an organizing committee for the Winter of Code. The organizing committee will ensure that the program is conducted smoothly and will also maintain a website for the event. The organizing committee is responsible for creating a basic filter for project proposals.",
            "For the first time in the year 2021, we have opened the NITK Winter of Code program for the students  other than NITK to submit proposals and participate in this program. They will be mentored by the organizations from NITK Surathkal."

The projects can be proposed by students (Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D.), faculty members, administrative offices, and by the various clubs at NITK willing to mentor students. The projects will be accepted by the organizing committee based on their merit and feasibility for the duration of the WOC program. New projects, as well as projects with an existing codebase, are allowed.",
                "Mentors must submit projects which can be worked on for a minimum period of 8 weeks. Each project must have 2 mentors. If an organization (any club) proposes projects, the organization must have an organization coordinator. Projects should be divided into small tasks/issues. The mentors are free to conduct any kind of evaluation (interviews, patch requirements, etc) required to select the candidates before the deadline.",
                "The students can apply to projects either by filling a Google form or completing a small task, which is at the discretion of the mentors. A student can apply to a maximum of 2 projects."
