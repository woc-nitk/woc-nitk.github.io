DMPNN is a graph convolutional model used for molecular property prediction. The model utilizes a hybrid representation which combines both graph convolutions and molecular descriptors. The model thus learns to construct molecular encodings by using convolutions centred on intramolecular bonds, rather than the atoms. This avoids unnecessary loops during the message passing phase.","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Nf9_1R30bTlYEf5Ix9JLuZU3dGUOR2tbpBooUBF3PXY","students":["Aryan Amit Barsainyan"],"openToAll":true},{"mentors":[{"email":"sushanth.191ee156@nitk.edu.in","name":"Sushanth Sathesh Rao"}],"title":"iACM","org":"ACM NITK","summary":"ACM-NITK undertakes many projects and events during the calendar year and we plan on handling and managing them using the iACM APP.
